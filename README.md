# Sati App for Awareness

The app promotes a practice of Self-observation by helping us get a reality check on our thoughts- bridging the gap between our fearful imaginations of future and how things really turn out to be. Various features allow us to note our thoughts, imaginations and enable us to observe and visualize our mind patterns as they are.
